Why is Goldman Sachs suing Malaysia over 1MDB scandal?
Prominent US investment bank in dispute with Malaysia over settlement relating to its role in scandal at state fund.
The United States investment bank Goldman Sachs has sued Malaysia in a London arbitration court amid rising tension over a settlement deal reached in connection with the bank’s role in the multibillion-dollar corruption scandal at state fund 1MDB.

Three years ago, New York-based Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $3.9bn to settle Malaysia’s criminal probe over the bank’s role in the scandal.
But the deal has been mired in disputes and this week Goldman filed for arbitration at the London Court of International Arbitration.

On Thursday, Malaysia’s 1MDB task force chairman Johari Abdul Ghani described the bank’s move to arbitration as “premature”, because the “parties are still considered to be in the amicable good faith discussions stage”.

Authorities in Malaysia and the United States say $4.5bn was stolen from the now-defunct fund in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Goldman executives and senior officials elsewhere.
Najib is now serving a 12-year prison term for his part in the scandal, while Goldman Sachs’s former partner and Southeast Asia chief Tim Leissner agreed to work with prosecutors in the US after pleading guilty in 2018 to money laundering and bribery charges.
