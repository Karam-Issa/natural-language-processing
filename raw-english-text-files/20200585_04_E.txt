India to bid for 2036 Olympics as IOC censures ‘politicisation of sport’
The IOC has warned against excluding athletes and teams for political reasons amid ‘growing politicisation of sport’.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has warned countries that exclude athletes from competing for political reasons they could risk harming their plans to host Olympic Games.

The “growing politicisation of sport” was flagged as a problem by IOC member Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic on Sunday in an update to global sports leaders about countries who want to host the games in future.
Meanwhile, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed that the world’s most populous nation will bid to host the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Poland and Indonesia have also expressed interest in hosting the 2036 Olympics – the next Summer Games available to be awarded.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the IOC session in Mumbai, Modi said hosting the Olympic Games is “the age-old dream” for India.

“Indians are not just sports lovers, but we also live it,” Modi said.

“India will leave no stone unturned in the preparation for the successful organisation of the Olympics in 2036 – this is the dream of the 140 crore [1.4 billion] Indians.”

“We want to realise this dream with your support. I am sure India will get constant support from IOC.”
A city or region was not specified by Modi but Ahmedabad, which boasts the largest stadium in the world with a capacity of 132,000 and is named after the Indian Prime Minister, would be a likely contender as the main host city for the country’s bid.
