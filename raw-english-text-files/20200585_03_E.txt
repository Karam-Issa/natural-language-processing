FIA to review Hamilton F1 Qatar GP track crossing incident
The FIA is launching a review into Lewis Hamilton’s actions and his punishment for crossing the track after his first-corner exit from Formula 1’s Qatar Grand Prix last weekend.
Hamilton was pitched out of the race at the Losail circuit after clashing with team-mate George Russell as they jostled for position on the run away from the start-line.

While Russell’s car escaped serious damage in the incident and he was able to continue, Hamilton was out on the spot and ended up in the gravel trap.

He swiftly jumped out of his Mercedes car and crossed the circuit as he tried to make his way back to the pits – which is a breach of regulations.
t was noted that he only just made it across the circuit before the lead pack came back through.

Hamilton was summoned to the stewards in Qatar to answer what happened.

Following an investigation, he was handed his first reprimand of the season and fined 50,000 Euros, of which 25,000 Euros was suspended for the remainder of the season pending no further breach of a similar nature.
